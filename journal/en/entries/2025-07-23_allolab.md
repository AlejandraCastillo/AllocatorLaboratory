## 🛠️ Fixes Before Starting

- I forgot to add a `.gitignore` (how nice it is that Android Studio handles all of that for you 😅).
- I had to delete my `.obsidian` folder, which I sometimes use to edit the technical journal from Obsidian.
- I added the `.gitignore` and made the corresponding commit.

## 💻 Coding...

Ok, the first thing I want to do is draw the bitmap, because I think it's key for me to understand what’s happening—especially now that I’m not applying unit tests yet.

So, step 1: have a bitmap and print it.  
I’ll use these symbols:  
- Filled block: ■ (U+25A0)  
- Empty block: □ (U+25A1)

And the bitmap will be an array of integers.

I want it to look like a matrix, so I need to come up with a good way to determine the height and width.  
Since I want the bitmap before the operation to appear next to the one after the operation, I think a width of 8 is appropriate. That way, each row is one byte.

I decided to switch the symbols to:  
- Filled block: `[x]`  
- Empty block: `[ ]`

I noticed I needed a function to save the initial bitmap state... I tried doing it like in high-level programming with a direct assignment, but of course that didn’t work 😆

It’ll take me some time to get used to it again, but I don’t think it’ll be long...
