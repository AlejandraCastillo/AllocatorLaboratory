## 🤐 I can't handle the journal today

Today is a shutdown day with mutism.  
And as if that weren't enough, my brain also decided to block my ability to write and think in Spanish — and I'm not that eloquent in English either.  
I don't think I'm going to write anything down here today, but I will be coding either way.  
Maybe tomorrow I'll come back to write today's thoughts in another entry.  
I have annotations and diagrams in a notebook, so I'm sure I can remember everything.

##  ✍️ Recovering the language, holding the focus

I stayed in mutism until very late, but at some point I recovered the ability to think in Spanish.  
Taking advantage of that, I decided to leave detailed comments in my code.  
Right now, I can't really talk about my thought process unless I’m doing it directly over the code, but I also can’t handle simplifying the comments in a way that doesn’t make them feel redundant with the code itself.  
At another time, I’ll revise the comments and translate them into English, but for now I’ll leave them as they are and save them here so I don’t lose the detailed explanation.

```c
int allocate_block(int block_size){
    for(int i = 0; i < BITMAP_SIZE; i++){ // we go through the bitmap
        if(bitmap[i] == 0){ // until we find a 0
            for(int j = 0; j < block_size; j++){ // then we count zeros until...
                if(bitmap[i+j] != 0){ // we find an occupied cell
                    i += j; // so we update i
                    j = block_size; // and exit this for loop
                }
                else if (j == block_size-1){ // or until we have a block of the right size
                    for(int k = 0; k < block_size; k++){ // then we go back to the start of the block
                        bitmap[i+k] = 1; // and mark it with 1s
                    }
                    return i; // and return the starting address of the block
                }
            } 
        }
    }
    return -1; // no space available
}
