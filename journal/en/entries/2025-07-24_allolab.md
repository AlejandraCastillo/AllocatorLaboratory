## 🤐 I can't handle the journal today

Today is a shutdown day with mutism.  
And as if that weren't enough, my brain also decided to block my ability to write and think in Spanish — and I'm not that eloquent in English either.  
I don't think I'm going to write anything down here today, but I will be coding either way.  
Maybe tomorrow I'll come back to write today's thoughts in another entry.  
I have annotations and diagrams in a notebook, so I'm sure I can remember everything.
