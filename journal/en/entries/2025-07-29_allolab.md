## 🤔 Wandering thoughts

Today I’ll work on how to store metadata about the allocated addresses and the size of the data they hold.

The idea is to create a map-like list (I know there are no maps in C, but with a struct this can be simulated) where I store the allocation table with occupied addresses and their respective sizes. That way, I know where a data block starts and ends, and can avoid deleting incomplete data. If I delete a block, I could mark the address as -1 in the array.

I also thought about writing a function that updates the allocation table, removes unused entries and reorders everything, since I understand that in C I can’t just delete something in the middle of an array.

I could also use this method of marking a slot as invalid (e.g. with -1) as a sign that it's empty, and run the cleanup function only when the array is full. That way we don’t have to constantly shift elements.

Though thinking about it further, maybe new addresses should be stored in the spaces left by old ones.

So, I think the best structure will store three things:

* The address
* The size of the data
* Whether this slot in the allocation table is in use

The last one doesn't refer to the bitmap, but to the allocation table specifically. So, when freeing a slot, I just mark it as not in use. Then, when storing a new address, I search for the first available space in the table.

## 🛠️ The plan

I’ll create a struct to store the address, data size, and whether it’s in use. Then I’ll create an array of this struct with a maximum size equal to the bitmap size (in case each block takes only one cell).

Then, I need to modify `allocate_block()` so that, before returning the memory address, it finds a free slot in the allocation table and saves the address and size there.

I’ll also need to update `free_block()` so that it no longer receives the size as a parameter. When the function starts:

* It first checks that the address exists (between 0 and the bitmap size).
* If not, it returns an error.
* Then it searches for the address in the allocation table.
* If it’s not found, that means no data was stored there → error.
* If found, it checks whether the slot is marked as “in use”.
* If it isn’t, return an error.
* If it is, retrieve the size.
* Free the memory in the bitmap as before.
* And finally mark that entry in the allocation table as free.

## 📌 Considerations

### ... when allocating memory

* What if the space requested is larger than the bitmap itself?
* What if the size is negative?

Both should be checked as the first step in the function.

### ... when freeing memory

* If we already retrieve a saved size from the system, should we still verify its consistency?

## 📝 Notes

* When retrieving the size from a saved address, we’re also validating that it exists and is currently in use.
* A same address might appear more than once marked as not in use, so we should search the entire table even after the first match.
* There are many error checks that might not be strictly necessary...

## 🔧 Plans

* It’s about time to split the code into multiple files.
