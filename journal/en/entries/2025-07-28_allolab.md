## 🛠️ The plan

I think this part is actually pretty simple. Since we’re still in level one, I’ll take the liberty of receiving the data size from an external source (i.e., as a parameter to the function), but I know that eventually I’ll need to handle it differently.

In this case, the function only receives the address and the size. Using a `for` loop, it walks through the bitmap starting at the given address and continues until the whole block is covered, replacing the 1s with 0s.

That’s exactly what I’m going to do this time, but I’ll also take the chance to write down some considerations I should keep in mind—and while I’m at it, some considerations for memory allocation too, since the day I wrote that function I didn’t have the energy to stop and think through this step.

## 📌 Considerations

### ...when allocating memory

- What happens if the space we want to allocate is larger than the entire bitmap?
- What happens if the requested size is a negative number?

Both of those should be checked at the beginning of the function.

### ...when freeing memory

- What if the given address is not actually the beginning of a data block?
- What if the size is wrong and we end up erasing more or less than the block?
  - What if that address and size reach the end of the bitmap before finishing?7
- What if the block, or part of it, is already free?

### Conclusions

In the end, I think I’ll need to include a way to store the starting address and size of each block. I’ll start by implementing the simpler version with the size as a parameter, but my next step will be to store size and address as metadata for the allocator.
