## ♾️ Note on my current state and adjustments to the technical journal

On Wednesday, July 30th, I realized I had entered a state of burnout, and I spent much of that morning thinking about how to handle this stage I'm going through. This led me to make a series of decisions.

My plan at the time was to keep programming every day and maintain my technical journal, although in a simpler version. However, the truth is that I haven’t had the energy to stick to that plan. I haven’t been able to program since then, and only today, Saturday, August 2nd, after lots of rest, have I gathered enough strength to upload this entry.

My recovery is going well, though it’s still slow. I still wake up tired every morning, feel like sleeping during the day, and have very little energy for anything. But at least I feel I’m managing to maintain a more consistent routine, and I wake up less exhausted than at the beginning. I think that’s already progress. Also, since that day, I had been having daily meltdowns… but today I didn’t have any. And that also feels like a small win. 💛

On one hand, I still don’t want to stop programming. At first, I thought I’d be able to do it daily, but now I see that’s not realistic for me right now. So I’ll only go back to coding when I feel like doing it won’t set back my recovery.

Programming still feels like a peaceful activity for me. It’s a kind of stimming: it helps me self-regulate, stay focused, and feel like my life has structure and balance. But I also understand that there’s no point in forcing myself if it goes against my healing. When I have the energy and motivation, I’ll do it. If not, resting is also a form of progress.

What I am clear about is that, as I mentioned before, I’m not going to keep the technical journal as neat and orderly as I used to. Even though it may seem like a simple task, keeping the journal the way I normally do takes a heavy cognitive toll. It’s an activity I usually enjoy, but it also demands a lot from me. And right now I don’t have the capacity to sustain that level of effort.

I’ll continue using the journal because it helps me think, but I’ll let go of the editing step I usually do before uploading it. I might not even translate it into English, or I’ll do it directly from the Spanish version without polishing it.

Normally, when I write my technical journal, I start with a messy draft where I lay out my plans, thoughts, and ramble a bit about the topic of the day. Then I turn it into a structured plan to begin working, and while I code, I take notes, adjust things, and record ideas —all of that ends up in the journal, if possible.

After that, I review the text and make sure it’s coherent, organized, and understandable to others. That last step, while useful, is especially draining for me because it involves a kind of social interaction. And as an autistic person, this type of task brings an additional burden. Sometimes I enjoy it, yes, but right now I simply don’t have the energy for it.

In fact, at this very moment I’m dictating my thoughts to ChatGPT, and I’m rambling and repeating myself quite a bit because these are my raw thoughts.
I have good writing skills —I enjoy writing, so I naturally tend to express myself clearly— but even so, I’m rambling much more than usual.
I’m using ChatGPT to help me synthesize and organize my thoughts while preserving as much of my natural way of expressing myself as possible.
I’m doing this because I simply don’t have the energy to edit this text myself, as I normally would.

Once I have the text organized in Spanish, I usually translate it into English with the help of AI. Then I check the indexes in both languages and update the links in each entry to make sure everything is properly connected: that each entry has its link to the index and to its version in the other language. Finally, I commit and push the journal to Git and GitHub.

This whole process is, again, very demanding for me. And although it may seem simple from the outside, right now I can’t sustain it without harming my recovery.
That’s why, during this stage, I’ll be uploading the journal directly in Spanish and in a disorganized way. I might include English versions, but no longer with the same structure or cleanliness as before.

This will probably be the last tidy entry I upload for a while.
I don’t know how long it will take for me to recover —I hoped it would only be one or two weeks, but I really don’t know. It’s uncertain.
For now, I’ll manage the journal in a messy way, though I’ll continue using it because it’s still a valuable tool for thinking and organizing when I program.

I’ll also keep programming whenever I feel like doing it.
But if I force myself to code without motivation, I feel like I’ll just be prolonging this burnout.

Finally, I want to clarify that from now on, my entries will simply be a disorganized journal.
Today, for example, I’ll upload two entries: this one, where I share my current state, and another with my raw thoughts for the day.
Even though I normally only post one entry per day, this time it felt necessary to separate them this way.
